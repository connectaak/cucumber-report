/*!
 * Assertion Constructor
 *
 * Creates object for chaining.
 *
 * `Assertion` objects contain metadata in the form of flags. Three flags can
 * be assigned during instantiation by passing arguments to this constructor:
 *
 * - `object`: This flag contains the target of the assertion. For example, in
 *   the assertion `expect(numKittens).to.equal(7);`, the `object` flag will
 *   contain `numKittens` so that the `equal` assertion can reference it when
 *   needed.
 *
 * - `message`: This flag contains an optional custom error message to be
 *   prepended to the error message that's generated by the assertion when it
 *   fails.
 *
 * - `ssfi`: This flag stands for "start stack function indicator". It
 *   contains a function reference that serves as the starting point for
 *   removing frames from the stack trace of the error that's created by the
 *   assertion when it fails. The goal is to provide a cleaner stack trace to
 *   end users by removing Chai's internal functions. Note that it only works
 *   in environments that support `Error.captureStackTrace`, and only when
 *   `Chai.config.includeStack` hasn't been set to `false`.
 *
 * - `lockSsfi`: This flag controls whether or not the given `ssfi` flag
 *   should retain its current value, even as assertions are chained off of
 *   this object. This is usually set to `true` when creating a new assertion
 *   from within another assertion. It's also temporarily set to `true` before
 *   an overwritten assertion gets called by the overwriting assertion.
 *
 * @param {Mixed} obj target of the assertion
 * @param {String} msg (optional) custom error message
 * @param {Function} ssfi (optional) starting point for removing stack frames
 * @param {Boolean} lockSsfi (optional) whether or not the ssfi flag is locked
 * @api private
